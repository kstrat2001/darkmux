# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to darkmux are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

darkmux is **pre-1.0**. Per the project's no-compat-baggage policy, breaking
changes ship cleanly while the surface stabilizes (no deprecation shims). Roadmap
**milestones** (`M1`/`M2`/`M3`…) are intentionally decoupled from these version
numbers, and the `RULES_SCHEMA` / `FLOW_SCHEMA` data-shape contracts version on
their own cadence (see `CLAUDE.md`). Semver stability begins at 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-15

The stability + security hardening release. A multi-agent code review swept the
whole codebase; this release lands the remediation — closing a path-traversal
write primitive, an audit-record loss gap, a config-precedence bypass, and two
runtime panics — alongside dispatch-boundary hardening and richer CLI output.

### Added
- **Colorized dispatch/lab telemetry + tabular CLI verbs (#776).** Run and lab
  telemetry render in color, and the tabular verbs align cleanly for at-a-glance
  reading.
- **`mission ship` is commit-identity-aware (#834).** It honors
  `conventions.json` `commit_author` and enforces a separation-of-duties guard.
- **Dispatch-boundary hardening.** Queue-originated `WorkJob.image` is validated
  at the queue boundary (#838) and `WorkJob.workdir` is base-restricted under
  `~/.darkmux/worktrees` (#840); the dispatch `docker run` invocation is hardened
  (#839).

### Fixed
- **Path traversal from untrusted model output (#867).** Model-supplied
  `mission.id` / `sprint.id` are validated with `fleet::validate_identifier`
  before any path construction, closing a constrained arbitrary-`.json`-write
  primitive in `mission propose`.
- **Audit-record silent loss (#877).** A dropped `AuditFileSink` write now leaves
  a durable breadcrumb in the local sink and `doctor` surfaces the dropped-write
  count, instead of a record vanishing under the best-effort `TeeSink`.
- **Config-precedence bypass (#875).** Production `DARKMUX_*` reads
  (`redis.stream`/`maxlen`, `audit.dir`/`enabled`, `default_role`, CORS origins)
  now route through `config_access`, so `config.json`-only operators get their
  settings honored.
- **Runtime panic on multibyte input (#873).** The compaction slot cap clamps to
  a char boundary before truncating, so a non-ASCII objective no longer panics
  `apply_slot_caps`.
- **Lab harness panic on non-ASCII (#869).** `detect_claim_verify_mismatch`
  builds its excerpt in a consistent index space, so a non-ASCII window around a
  matched claim phrase no longer panics after the dispatch ran.
- **`requires_fixture` honesty (#871).** The matcher is documented as literal
  `name@version` and loudly rejects semver operators that would silently never
  match.
- **Stale `prompt_tokens` (#854).** A stale token count is detected and a local
  estimate substituted for the compaction trigger, fixing a suppressed
  compaction + phantom context drop.
- **`mission ship` from inside a worktree (#844, #846).** Post-merge
  sprint-complete + teardown no longer silently drift when run from the worktree
  layout; the viewer counts `session.end` as a dispatch terminal (#856).
- **Config tier no longer leaks into tests (#811).** Test builds neutralize the
  config tier by construction, so test flow records never reach the operator's
  real Redis stream and default-assertion tests don't flake on a populated
  `config.json`.

### Documentation
- Research-grounded `ROADMAP.md` with themed post-1.0 milestones (M4 loop-depth
  lead) and verified per-theme citations (#850, #853).
- Orchestrator-first getting-started, post-1.0 framing, screenshot refresh, and
  an em-dash cleanup pass across the public docs (#858, #859, #860, #861, #862,
  #863).

[1.2.0]: https://github.com/kstrat2001/darkmux/releases/tag/v1.2.0

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-14

The work-level observability release: missions become a first-class lens —
across the fleet, in the CLI, and on the dashboard — so you can see how a
mission progresses (sprints + the run→qa→gate→ship cycle), not just what each
machine is doing.

### Added
- **Missions lens in the viewer (#827).** A `fleet | missions` toggle adds a
  work-centric view alongside the machine-centric fleet view — "all machines as
  one" at the work level. A missions index lists every mission with sprint
  progress + cross-machine token rollup; the detail renders the durable sprint
  plan with each sprint's status and a **run → qa → gate → ship cycle strip**,
  click-through to the per-machine run (#828, #832, #833).
- **`darkmux mission status` (#829).** The global mission-control read,
  completing the `<noun> status` family (`flow status`, `model status`): every
  mission grouped by status with sprint progress, the drift that needs
  attention (a Closed mission with a non-terminal sprint; an open mission whose
  sprints are all done), and copy-pasteable, state-accurate reconcile commands.
  Read-only; `--json` for the orchestrator / CI (#830, #831).

### Fixed
- **Live-diff no longer flickers/reloads (#826).** The session-view diff panel
  was rebuilt on every live record (~1/sec during a run), destroying its DOM
  and scroll; it now paints into a stable mount, repainting only on real
  changes with scroll preserved.

### Internal
- A bundled maintainer skill, `darkmux-point-release`, standardizes this release
  ceremony (not shipped to brew installs).

[1.1.0]: https://github.com/kstrat2001/darkmux/releases/tag/v1.1.0

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-13

darkmux 1.0 — semver stability begins. The release that closes the loop:
darkmux now runs the full local dispatch-to-PR cycle, shows the work (and the
savings) live, and was used to build itself — the observability features in
this release were shipped through `mission run`, and the savings figure on
darkmux.com is this release's own development telemetry.

### Added
- **`mission run` / `mission ship` / `mission abort` — the local dispatch-to-PR
  loop (#782).** `run` creates an isolated git worktree, dispatches the coder
  (sprint-bound, internal runtime), runs the local `code-reviewer` QA against
  the diff, and STOPS at a sign-off gate; `ship` commits, pushes, opens the PR,
  and (opt-in, green-gated) squash-merges — never auto-merge (#786, #787, #788).
- **Verbatim spec fidelity (#815).** `mission propose --ticket <ID>` stamps the
  operator's unabridged input onto the mission; every coder brief carries it
  under an authority-stamped provenance block, so exact strings and constraints
  survive the mission-compiler's summarization (#820).
- **Repo-level shipping conventions (#816).** `<repo>/.darkmux/conventions.json`
  — branch/commit-subject/PR-title templates with `{ticket}`/`{sprint}`/
  `{mission}`/`{subject}` vars, a PR body template, and PR labels. Ship pushes
  the worktree's actual branch, so mid-flight conventions edits can't drift
  (#821).
- **Per-turn token telemetry (#795).** The runtime tailer emits a
  `telemetry.tokens` flow record per model turn (FLOW_SCHEMA 1.13) — the
  dashboard's savings odometer climbs live DURING a dispatch (#800).
- **The savings hero (#783, #803).** "Tokens off the meter" headline with a
  token-class breakdown — generated / fresh input / re-read input — that
  teaches the agent-loop economics (a typical day: ~90% of input is re-read
  context). Tokens only, never currency (#791–#793, #804, #805).
- **Orchestrator notes (#807, #817, #819).** A real channel for the frontier
  orchestrator's voice: `darkmux flow note --source orchestrator` renders as
  the card's conclusion with a history modal; gate/ship print ready-to-paste
  scaffolds (session-id pre-filled) splitting upbeat dashboard notes from
  session-scoped technical adjudications; ship soft-warns when a gated sprint
  ships with a noteless trail (#808, #812, #818, #819, #822).
- **Live diff (#756).** `GET /diff/:session_id` serves the running git diff of
  a mission-run worktree (path-contained, ref-validated, size-bounded); the
  session view renders it live — watch the agent's code form in real time. The
  endpoint was built end-to-end by the local coder through `mission run`
  (#801, #802).
- **Activity-driven live headline (#789).** The viewer's headline tracks the
  live session (mission-scoped → clickable) and reads an affirmative fleet
  status when idle (#790).
- **CLI styling pass (#772–#776).** Semantic color across doctor / scan /
  model-status / profiles / dispatch telemetry, tty-gated (#777–#781).
- **Runtime image on GHCR (#759).** The `darkmux-runtime` image publishes on
  release and pulls on demand — `brew install darkmux` alone can dispatch
  (#764, #765).
- **darkmux.com refresh.** Homebrew-first install docs, copy-to-clipboard on
  all snippets, and the live savings-hero screenshot under the why-headline —
  real work, real telemetry, not a mockup (#763, #766–#770, #784/#823).

### Fixed
- **Saturated Redis streams no longer drop the live tail (#809).** Day reads
  and fleet completion-waits now read newest-first (`XREVRANGE`); at the
  `MAXLEN` cap the oldest records age out instead of the newest vanishing
  (#810).
- **Live-tail idempotency (#794).** SSE re-delivery is identity-deduped so
  cumulative readouts can't inflate and "reset" on refresh (#796).
- Activity-timeline rightmost bar no longer clips past the track (#797);
  savings hero is always visible and compact on mobile (#792, #793).

[1.0.0]: https://github.com/kstrat2001/darkmux/releases/tag/v1.0.0

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-11

First tagged release. 0.9.0 exercises the full Homebrew + release pipeline ahead
of 1.0; it captures the work merged on `main` since the changelog was seeded.

### Added
- **`config.json` configuration subsystem (#661).** `darkmux init` writes a
  self-documenting `~/.darkmux/config.json` with the common knobs visible (not
  hidden as code-defaults). Every setting resolves with one precedence —
  `env(DARKMUX_*) > config.json > built-in default` — surfaced by `darkmux doctor`.
  Off-by-default integrations are `enabled`-gated blocks; the Redis password is the
  only carve-out (macOS Keychain, never plaintext) (#662–#679).
- **Daemon-hosted observability viewer + playback catalog (#557, #691).**
  `darkmux serve` serves the viewer at `GET /` with a live SSE tail; a rolling 24h
  live window driven by presence heartbeats; a `/flow-days` catalog with a day
  picker; first-class event search; an expandable recent-runs list and an
  unscoped-records section (#582–#584, #682, #710, #715, #723–#729, #731, #748).
- **Presence-driven live fleet view (#638).** A machine shows in the live fleet
  when it's heartbeating — records or not — and consistently across live and
  playback (#651, #653).
- **In-sandbox compile via binary injection (#703).** `crew dispatch --image <any
  Linux image>` injects darkmux's static runtime binary into that image, so the
  coder/test-designer roles can run the inner verify loop (`cargo check`/`test`,
  etc.) in-sandbox. darkmux ships no per-language images — bring the agent, you
  bring the environment (#705–#708).
- **`darkmux flow tail` verb (#695)** — follow flow records live from the CLI (#740).
- **Google Antigravity orchestrator support** with zero-config auto-detection, plus
  unified orchestrator naming (#734, #735, #738).
- **`mission_id` / `sprint_id` stamped on crew-dispatch flow records (#716).**
- **`SECURITY.md` + a `cargo-audit` CI job** (daily + dependency-gated) (#744).
- **Homebrew distribution (#618).** The `kstrat2001/homebrew-darkmux` tap is live
  with a formula auto-synced from `main`; docs lead with `brew install` (#650, #652,
  #654). (Stable bottled release lands with this tag.)
- `doctor` proactively surfaces the Docker runtime requirement (#680) and warns when
  `OPENAI_BASE_URL` would silently defeat `darkmux swap` (#5) (#681, #753).
- Capability-based model selection scaffolding: capability vectors on `ProfileModel`,
  a `select_model` scorer, and a two-value `role_family` axis (#588, #599, #592).
- Machine-level `internal.utility` model — one global utility/compactor per machine,
  loaded alongside workers on `swap`, with a `doctor` loaded-guard and a
  pre-compaction loaded-check (#593, #594, #602).
- `lab doctor` fixture-cleanliness check — flags stray run-artifact dirs left in a
  fixture source (#610).
- The viewer respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (drops the infinite live-badge pulse) (#238, #751).

### Changed
- **OpenClaw is now opt-in, not the default.** `swap` patches openclaw config only
  under an explicit `--runtime openclaw`; `crew dispatch` / `lab run` default to the
  internal Docker-bounded runtime (#606, #607).
- **The fleet executor is now the `runner`** (was `worker`) — a single overloaded
  term retired; `lab-runner` → `lab-manager` to resolve the collision (#595, #659,
  #660, #688).
- **`DARKMUX_LMSTUDIO_URL` is now the base URL** — callers append `/v1/...`
  (semantic break) (#673).
- **The profiles registry is configured as `profiles`** — `DARKMUX_PROFILES` env and
  the `--profiles-file` flag (renamed from the misleading `--config`/`DARKMUX_CONFIG`,
  then from `--profiles`) now that a real `config.json` exists (#677, #739).
- **`swap --recommended`** replaces the reserved `"recommended"` profile name (#700, #702).
- **`profiles.json` gains `schema_version` + forward-compatible extras** so an older
  binary tolerates a newer file (#694, #712).
- Viewer output-encoding hardening — record-derived fields are escaped at the
  template edge and clicks run through one delegated handler (no inline handlers);
  container-written trajectory fields are bounded at ingest (#237, #743, #749).
- `swap` treats a profile's `n_ctx` as a minimum, not an exact size (#600).
- `crew dispatch` resolves and logs the `--profile` override rather than silently
  using the registry default (#608).
- Fleet work-routing collapsed to a single `darkmux:work` stream (first-available
  claims); per-tier routing retired (#604).
- The internal runtime writes its bookkeeping (`.darkmux-runtime/`) to a mounted
  out-dir, never inside the workspace it operates on (#611).
- One canonical `RUN_ARTIFACT_DIRS` shared by the lab clone, the content hash, and
  the workspace-delta view; per-run clones are pruned clean by construction (#609).
- The frontier-orchestrator label generalized from `frontier-claude` to `frontier`,
  with richer telemetry formatting (#738).

### Removed (breaking, pre-1.0)
- `ModelRole` — `default_model` is the canonical worker (#601).
- Machine-tier across the stack: `Role.tier`, `FlowRecord.machine_tier`,
  `WorkJob.target_tier`, and the `{inference/hub/client}` taxonomy (#587, #604, #605).
- `ProfileRuntime` camelCase serde aliases — fields are snake_case only (#699, #709).
- Run-manifest keys normalized to snake_case (#698, #719).
- Dead fixture-manifest fields `hash_include` / `hash_exclude` (never consumed) (#610).

### Fixed
- `DarkmuxPaths.profiles` pointed at `profiles.yaml` instead of `profiles.json` (#585).
- Atomic line append in `LocalFileSink` — fixes concurrent-write tearing and a
  crew-dispatch flake (#667).
- Internal dispatch is bookended with a terminal record; killed runs are recognized
  as `dispatch.error` rather than reading as still-running (#717, #718, #720, #721).
- The live SSE stream re-targets the new day file on UTC date rollover (#730, #731).
- The runtime returns a non-zero exit status on `EscalationTriggered` (#737).
- Lab fixture content-hash drift from stray `coverage/` and `.darkmux-agent/` dirs —
  now excluded from the hash and pruned from per-run clones (#609).
